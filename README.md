[_The Nature of Code_](https://natureofcode.com/book/) introduces many concepts to simulate real-world phenomena with code. Here, I try to create a few demos with [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) and [Love2D](https://love2d.org/) to learn about these concepts.

The notes which follow are my own, and try to formalize what I learn from the book and from [the dedicated playlist](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCodingTrain/playlists?view=50&sort=dd&shelf_id=9) on [The Coding Train YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCodingTrain).
